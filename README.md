# Development of iskandarprojects.com
________________________________________________
## Background
iskandarprojects.com is a website that is currently under development by me, Iskandar Shoyusupov, with the main
purpose of utilizing it as a portfolio page for my projects and interests. This is also a new foray into the unknown
art of web development, which while not my main strength, is something I wanted to learn. Making my own website 
through bare bone HTML, CSS, and Javascript without the use of applets seemed like a good way to go. 

## Used Resources 

### Digital Ocean Cloud Platform 
Digital Ocean is a cloud infrastructure provider that hosts my website. It is the server itself that provides 
the necessary computing resources I need to have my website online 

### Server Pilot 
Server pilot sets up my server that is on digital ocean for hosting. 

### Namescheap domain name provider 
The domain name associated with iskandarprojects.com was bought from namescheap, which pairs the ip 
164.92.76.30 with a more desirable name which will make it easier to be found for users 

### WinSCP 
WinSCP was used to SFTP files from my windows machine to the ubuntu interface the server was based on. Development 
was also done on a ubuntu terminal where I could SSH into as a system user of the server, utilizing vim for 
fast code changes.
