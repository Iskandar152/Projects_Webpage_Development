# Development of iskandarprojects.com
________________________________________________
## Background
iskandarprojects.com is a website that is currently under development by me, Iskandar Shoyusupov, with the main
purpose of utilizing it as a portfolio page for my projects and interests. This is also a new foray into the unknown
art of web development, which while not my main strength, is something I wanted to learn. Making my own website 
through bare bone HTML, CSS, and Javascript without the use of applets seemed like a good way to go.
